Joust 2.3 Documentation
-----------------------

By Erin S Catto

Here is Joust v2.3.  No exciting changes.
Just mitigation of the bonus round bug.

The Game:             0    =    start, replay, up
                      /    =    right
                      9    =    left

Points:               1 point per egg touched
                      8 points for clearing bonus round
                      1 player for clearing bonus round

NOTE:  Only use SCHIP v1.1 to run this game.
