       This game, as well as the others for this scene, are FREE
       and freely ditributable. If you paid to have it, you have
       been stolen. If you got money to give it, you're a thief.



       The rules of this game are very simple: the game is played
       in a variable size grid made of 3*3 to 8*8 squares, so the
       level of the game is designated by the width of the grid.
       Initially, all the squares of the grid are WHITE. The goal
       is to turn then BLACK by inverting their color, knowing
       that inverting the colour of a square will also invert these
       of the squares placed just on the left, right, up and down
       of it...
       Some levels are very simple: level 3 can be finished with
       only 5 inversions, and level 4 needs only 4 inversions to
       be completed...
       Once a level is completed, the game is finished. To play
       again, just reset the emulator.

       I know I could have implemented some sort of inversions
       counter, and next-level playing after a level is finished,
       but I missed some time to do this... Anyway, have fun !

       I could also have given the source of this program, but it
       is not documented, so it would not be interesting to those
       who are looking for help in programming.


       The keys are:
                   [8] :   UP
                   [4] :   LEFT (lower level under level selection)
                   [5] :   INVERT SQUARE (start game under level selection)
                   [6] :   RIGHT (upper level under level selection)
                   [2] :   DOWN
